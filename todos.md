<!-- - README code does not include import RedisSMQ -->

- cleanup (delete) downloaded PDF files?
- unify logs into service.log, rename to ocr_pdf.log???
- config logs path to be able to use /var/logs on production ?
- change the PORT number default in order to be able to be installed along-side our other services in the same machine. Should we have a pattern for future services?
- create `config.yml` with default values instead of explanation of creating the file
- make sure tests use config for testing redis container
- setup github CI with lint, formatting, tests ...
- make sure works on mac
- decide which languages to support
- divide dependencies into prod and dev requirements files
- setup_venv needs to stop on error to avoid insalling local packages
- Nice to have: allow upping the service without redis if you only want to use the sync method
